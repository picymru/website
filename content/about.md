## A little about us...
Welcome to PiCymru, an organisation and community dedicated to promoting computing through the use of the Raspberry Pi mini-computer in Wales. The Raspberry Pi is a powerful little computer that retails for around £25 to £35 and is manufactured in Pencoed, Wales. It provides a cheap, low power device to learn and experiment on and has been used in thousands of great projects around the world.

PiCymru aims to inspire people into computing and bring together those starting their journey together with experienced hobbyists and professionals who are using the Raspberry Pi to do great things. We organise meet up events called Jams to get the local community together to talk about their projects and experiences and demonstrate their work.

## The Team
### Founders
#### Matthew Gall
Very keenly interested in education, Matthew is a Trust & Safety Engineer for [CloudFlare](https://cloudflare.com) currently specialising in live threat analysis, data processing and distributed intelligence. When he isn't working, you can usually find Matthew travelling around the United Kingdom, encouraging children and young people to take up computing using tools such as the Raspberry Pi.

#### Douglas (Doug) Gore
By trade an embedded systems engineer, Doug is a geek, pure and simple. When he isn't playing around with Qt, trying to emulate the Odeon Cinema introduction reel, you can usually find Doug nose deep in a Raspberry Pi on his latest project.

### Project Leaders
#### Julian Milligan
Inspired by a talk by our founder, Matthew Gall, about the importance of spreading knowledge, Julian became a STEM ambassador and later founded a CoderDojo in his home town of Carmarthen. Julian was inaugarated as the first PiCymru project leader on Saturday 7th June.
