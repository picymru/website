Today PiCymru are pleased to announce that Cardiff University will be joining our existing partners in supporting the Pioneer scheme operated by the Raspberry Pi Foundation (see https://www.raspberrypi.org/pioneers/).

Cardiff University will provide two additional city centre locations in Newport, at the National Software Academy and Cardiff for the meetup event along with our existing partners, Bridgend College, University of Wales Trinity Saint David and Cwmaman Community Centre.
 
On 9th January 2017, the Raspberry Pi Foundation, the charity behind the Raspberry Pi, launched the Pioneers scheme, encouraging anyone in the UK between the ages of twelve and fifteen to get involved and design some technology to "make us laugh". The Pioneers scheme fills the gap between Code Club aimed at nine to eleven year olds and GCSE Computing. Participants do not need any prior coding experience.
 
A key part of the initiative will be a meetup on Friday 17th February at the National Software Academy, Newport, Cardiff University, Bridgend College campus, the University of Wales Trinity St David - Mount Pleasant campus and Cwmaman Community Centre to provide hands on support to students signed up to the Pioneers scheme. The meetup will provide coding & engineering support, the use of additional equipment and assistance in filming of videos for submission on March 22nd.
 
Douglas Gore, founder of PiCymru said "With the addition of Cardiff University's support most of South Wales now have a regional centre nearby to get support with the Pioneers scheme. We hope this will further extend support for the scheme in Wales and produce many more entries."
 
Catherine Teehan, Placement Office at Cardiff University commented "Software development really is an exciting, and growing, line of work that provides so many opportunities to work on a range of projects in a variety of sectors. We hope that by supporting events like the ‘Pioneer’ competition we can inspire the next generation to consider studying and working in this field.”
 
“We are delighted to welcome these highly talented coders to the University on Feb 17th to test out their software engineering skills as part of this national competition. We are looking forward to seeing the students’ innovative creations on display and hope that they will gain a wealth of experience from the activities that we have organised for them.”
