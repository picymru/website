Hello there and welcome to the brand new PiCymru website.
<!--more-->
When I started PiCymru as a simple Google Group late last year I wasn't sure what the response would be but within days the  group was growing rapidly and all kinds of interesting projects and initiatives were being discussed. Since then has been a Jam event in Swansea and another one to be held shortly in Cardiff.

With the help of Matthew Gall and our supporters today marks a new chapter for PiCymru as we move towards becoming a stronger, more defined initiative by giving ourselves a proper home on the web. Please take a look around the site and let us know what you think. We hope to build on it in the near future to provide more ways to connect with the Raspberry Pi community in Wales.

Enjoy!

Doug
