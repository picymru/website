PiCymru hosted it's 3rd Raspberry Jam on Sunday 15th May 2016. For this Jam we returned to our roots with a single room, talk focused event at the excellent TechHub Swansea. TechHub's event space was bigger and better this time as they had recently moved to a stunning new building in Urban Village on the High Street.

Once again the date we had chosen turned out to be beautiful sunny day, it is becoming a bit of a running joke that a PiCymru jam day is also a good day to head to the beach.

We arrived and set up for the event. Doug arrived a little later than planned after realising he forgot his laptop on the way to the event, resulting in a hasty rush home.

The attendees started to trickle in as we rushed around getting all the equipment set up. By about 10.20am most people had arrived and we kicked off the proceedings. Matthew hosted the event while Doug co-ordinated the event and social media.

## Talks

### Julian Milligan
We started the talks with Julian Milligan (@darthmill) from CoderDojo Carmarthen giving a presentation about his work with physical computing and Minecraft on the Pi.

Julian has always been keen to share his latest and greatest projects at our Jams and this one was no exception. As anyone who has children knows most of them are completely obsessed with Minecraft, the hugely successful creative computer game.

## Show and tell

### Retropie

### Loopy Fruits

What happens when a software engineer attempts electronics? You get Loopy Fruits, a fruit based music mixing project. Doug first demoed this project as PiFun back in 2014 using Scratch and some custom software that turned Raspberry Pi with a simple breadboard circuit into a replica of the popular Makey Makey.

What makes this project different from many of the other similar Raspberry Pi projects that interface with fruit is there is no HAT board or additional hardware needed. Also just like a Makey Makey it can act as an input device. The PiFun software converts contact with the fruit into virtual keyboard key presses such allowing any software to be used.

The children who attended the event flocked to the curiously wired up bananas and after a little explaination of the need to touch the apple *and* the banana were soon making music.

Loopy Fruits itself is a simple Pygame based project that would play 5 syncronised music loops that are activated and decactivated with the bananas.

PiCymru will be releasing the updated version of this project soon once we have ironed out a few issues.

### Robots

Various robots were on display throughout the day. Julian brought his latest robotic creation "Susan", Doug had PiCymru's first robot "Rubus TITAN" on display and Swansea Hackspace has various Arduino based robots there.
