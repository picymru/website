Join Julian Milligan, project leader for PiCymru's first supported project - CoderDojo Carmarthen, as he leads you on a mystical and mysterious adventure through the lands of Minecraftia using your Raspberry Pi. From making your character into King Midas, and rigging all manner of explosions. All we know, should you see a creeper, you may need to run.

#### Tim Lewis
##### Tiny but mighty: exploring the untapped potential of the Raspberry Pi
Join games programmer Tim Lewis as he talks about some of the projects he's been working on and workshops he's run using the surprisingly capable Raspberry Pi computers. From robotics to realtime 3D graphics - we've only just begun to scratch the surface of what these remarkable machines are capable of.

#### Giakonda IT
##### Taking the Pi Off Grid
Giakonda have been involved in bringing the Raspberry Pi to classrooms in Siavonga, Zambia. This task is not straightforward when many classrooms in Africa do not have electricity.
